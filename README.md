###How to translate the content of your entities?

Sometimes the Symfony's Book is cool but difficult to understand. I wanted share with you how to translate the content of your entities.

1. Create your Symfony's Project
2. Create your database
3. Change your files config.yml and parameters.yml
4. Create your entity (to practice)
5. Create your CRUD (to practice)
6. You need a dictionnary 
7. You need TWIG!

LET'S GO :D
